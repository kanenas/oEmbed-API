Allow others to easily embed your blog posts on their sites using oEmbed.

## Description ##

It’s pretty easy to embed YouTube videos or tweets in WordPress. Just paste the URL to the content on a new line and you automagically get a preview of the embed.

We wondered why this doesn’t also work with WordPress blogs and created this little plugin here.

This plugin makes WordPress an oEmbed provider, which means you can easily embed your blog posts somewhere else. Even on your own website!

The beautiful embeds contain a short summary of the post and (if available) also its featured image.

Everything is easily extensible. You can completely change the look and feel of the embedded content.

**Note:** We are working on bringing this functionality to WordPress core at one point. See WordPress Core ticket [\#32522](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32522) for more details.

**Get Involved**

We hold weekly chats about this plugin in the \#feature-oembed WordPress Slack channel. Read the [announcement post](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/17/oembed-feature-plugin/) for more information.

## Installation ##

### Manual Installation ###

1. Upload the entire `/oembed-api` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate oEmbed API through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Copy the permalink of one of your blog posts and paste it into a new post. It should automatically be embedded.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Is the REST API required for this plugin to work? ###

While we support the REST API, it is not required for this plugin to run. The only thing you need is an up-to-date version of WordPress.

### How does it work again? ###

We leverage a technique called oEmbed. Thanks to oEmbed, you can embed content from the web by only knowing its URL. While WordPress has supported this feature since version 2.9, it actually isn’t an oEmbed provider itself. That’s what we’re changing.

This plugin is fully compliant with the JSON specification at [oEmbed.com](http://oembed.com).

### Is it really that easy? ###

Yes.

### How can I replace the blue WordPress logo in my embeds? ###

The WordPress logo is displayed when there’s no site icon available. Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the Customizer and it will be used in the embed too.

### Why can’t I embed site XY? ###

The oEmbed API plugin needs to run on both sites so the embedded site serves the right HTML and that your site knows how to embed it.

### Why is my embedded site not showing? ###

When you get an empty preview, it’s possible that the embedded site has the `X-Frame-Options` header set. This prevents loading the site in an iframe for security reasons.

## Developer Reference ##

There are some handy functions developer can use with this plugin.

For example, `get_post_embed_url` returns the URL to a post’s embed template used for the iframe, while `get_post_embed_html` returns the `<iframe>` tag to do this.

To complement these two functions, `get_oembed_endpoint_url` returns the URL to the oEmbed API endpoint itself.
